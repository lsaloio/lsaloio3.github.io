                                        <h1>Introduction to key accessibility features</h1>
                                        <p>Digital accessibility as a design goal strives to make electronic content available and usable by everyone, including and especially people with disabilities. There are many ways to make digital content more accessible in MadCap Flare. The following sections introduce the importance of implementing  the appropriate heading levels, lists, alternative text, and color contrast for your content.</p>
                                        <div class="MCDropDown MCDropDown_Closed dropDown"><span class="MCDropDownHead dropDownHead"><a href="#" class="MCDropDownHotSpot dropDownHotspot MCDropDownHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" aria-expanded="false"><img class="MCDropDown_Image_Icon" src="../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="16" width="18" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />Heading levels and lists</a></span>
                                            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                                                <p>Both heading levels and lists are useful for organizing your content. Structurally, these elements break up the information in a way that is more readable and establishes some relationship between information. This is helpful for people with disabilities that might have a hard time processing visual information, such as people with visual impairments, ADHD, or dyslexia. Some people that are blind use a screen reader program, which is software that communicates with a computer’s operating system to convey information on the screen to the user. Formatting your information with heading levels and lists allows the screen reader to tell users what information is a heading, or what information is part of a list. Heading levels and lists communicate a form of organization of the page’s content to people with disabilities that may not be able to interpret it visually. They provide a stable, consistent, and predictable structure, while also giving us information cues about what users are reading.</p>
                                                <h2>Using heading levels for accessibility</h2>
                                                <p>Headings not only let readers know how content is organized, but they also serve as a way to rank the content and nest sections within larger sections. For accessibility, headings are especially important because they provide in-page navigation for web browsers and assistive technologies, such as screen readers. Since headings are visually large and distinct from surrounding text, using them is also very helpful for users with cognitive disabilities.</p>
                                                <p>The heading that is considered most important, and is largest in size, is the &lt;h1&gt; heading. The least important, and the smallest in size, is the &lt;h6&gt; heading. You should begin new sections with a higher or equal ranked heading. Subsections that are part of the higher ranked sections begin with lower ranked headings.</p>
                                                <p>For example, consider how a web page about your favorite foods would use headings. You might have different sections for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert. For the Breakfast section, the &lt;h1&gt; heading might be “Breakfast,” with &lt;h2&gt; headings starting subsections for “Waffles” and “French toast.”</p>
                                                <p>

                                                <p>Within each subsection, there might also be &lt;h3&gt; headings to begin smaller subsections about what recipes you liked for each food, and what ones you didn’t. This hierarchical pattern could be repeated, with another &lt;h1&gt; heading for “Lunch” starting a new section.</p>

                                                <p>Lists are an essential way to group information together in a visually distinct and organized way, rather than typing out the information in a hard-to-read paragraph. They show the reader that there is a relationship between items and break up information into a more digestible form. The structural elements of lists are also very important for accessibility, because they inform users that are using a screen reader that a set of items should be considered a group. There are four types of lists: unordered, ordered, description, and nested.</p>
                                                <h3>Unordered lists</h3>
                                                <p>Unordered lists are often marked with a bullet point, and represent information that does not need to be in a specific order.</p>

This is made possible thanks to screen readers, which read out your content automatically. But if an image doesn’t have alt text, then the screen reader won’t know what to do and skip it. An image that has crucial details but no alt text relaying those details might as well not exist in the eyes of a screen reader, and by extension those with a visual disability.  Alternative text is a short description of what is in the image and why you have included it in your project, unless that information is already given in text close to the image. If you include a photo of a cute cat on your blog, you should give it the alt text of “Cute Cat.” Without alt text, your image might as well not exist for people with the aforementioned disabilities.</p>

                                                <p>Don’t put alt text in decorative images. Images that are there for set dressing and not important, like a decorative banner or pictures of cats on a page not about cats, should not have alt text. If they did, that would interrupt a screen reader while it reads the content. Include the string &lt;img alt=""&gt; on an image so the screen reader knows to skip over it.</p>

                                                <h2>What are the Components of Color?</h2>
                                                <p>Three things to consider when pairing colors together is hue, saturation, and value. Hue refers to the color you are using.  Saturation is the range of vibrancy to subtlety of a color or hue. Value is the brightness of a color, ranging from white to black. Experimenting with these characteristics will help you curate the perfect color palette.</p>
                                                <h2>What is Color Contrast?</h2>
                                                <p>When picking colors for your website, legibility is top priority.  Picking high contrast colors for your site allows your text to be distinct and clear from your background. Colors with an insufficient contrast ratio leaves users straining to read, navigate or comprehend your site. It is an accessibility issue because it renders your website unusable to readers.  This is especially true for colorblind or low vision users, who need a high level of contrast to make a distinction between the background and text of a website.  Therefore, use contrast to pick strikingly different colors for your website and maintain readability.</p>

While the colors are less harsh on the eye, the softness of both the foreground and background color doesn't have enough distinction for a clear foreground. This lack of contrast would be difficult to read and eventually be straining when attempting to read longer chunks of text</p>
